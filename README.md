I attended a Power BI workshop conducted by GrowthSchool where I learned how to create engaging and insightful dashboards using this powerful data visualization tool. During the workshop mentored by Deeksha Anand, I was able to apply my newly acquired skills and knowledge to create my dashboard. It was an exciting experience to see how easily I could transform raw data into a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format that could communicate key insights to others.
